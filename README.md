Project Description:
This project focuses on creating an end-to-end chatbot using Python. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversations with users, providing responses based on predefined intents. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques for text processing and machine learning for intent classification.

The libraries that we us in the code help us to read and write files and interact with our operating system. We also deal with data that comes in from unverified HTTPS by overlapping the security layer. We import machine learning model to predict the our outcome in binary by classifyig which class the input belongs and depending on that the response of the chatbot varies. We also classify the words into a matrix on the basis of how frequetly they occur in relative to the document it belongs to by using tfidvectorizer. We also import NLTK that helps us to break piece of texts into sentenses.
